# INCLUDES METHOD

The **includes()** method determines whether an array includes a certain value among its entries, returning true or false as appropriate.

```JS
const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const isValueOfTwoInThere = array1.includes(2);
// expected value: true

const isValueOfFiveInThere = array1.includes(5);
// expected value: false
```

For this exercise we want you to build a isArrayIncludes() function that solves the same task with **for loops ONLY**.

A isArrayIncludes() function should
* Take an array and a value as arguments (2)
* Return boolean that stands fo that fact that the array includes the value or not.
